        "\n",
        "**1. Data Loading:** The code starts by loading data from three CSV files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. This data contains information about customers, products, and their purchase history.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Data Preparation:** The ECommerceAnalyzer class is initialized with the loaded data. It performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation steps to prepare the data for analysis. This involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Converting dates to datetime objects.\n",
        "- Creating customer features like total transactions, total spend, and average transaction value.\n",
        "- Creating combined features that include customer demographics and product categories purchased.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Lookalike Identification:**\n",
        "The core logic lies in the find_lookalikes method. This method calculates the cosine similarity between customers based on their features. It then identifies the most similar customers (lookalikes) for a given customer ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Output Generation:** The generate_lookalikes_csv method iterates through a specified number of customers and finds their lookalikes. It then creates a CSV file named Mansi_Waghmare_Lookalike.csv containing the customer ID and their corresponding lookalikes with similarity scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lookalike Modeling:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Lookalike modeling is a technique used in marketing and data science to identify new potential customers who share similar characteristics with your existing high-value customers. It is a powerful tool for:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Customer Acquisition:** By targeting lookalike audiences, you can expand your customer base by reaching individuals who are likely to be interested in your products or services.\n",
        "Targeted Marketing: Lookalike modeling enables you to tailor your marketing campaigns to specific audience segments with higher conversion rates.\n",
        "Personalized Recommendations: You can leverage lookalike information to provide more relevant and personalized product recommendations to your customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lookalike modeling typically involves the following steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define your seed audience: This is your group of existing high-value customers.\n",
        "- Data Collection and Feature Engineering: Gather data about your seed audience and create relevant features that represent their characteristics.\n",
        "- Model Training: Train a machine learning model (like cosine similarity in this case) to identify patterns and similarities within the seed audience data.\n",
        "- Lookalike Audience Generation: Apply the trained model to a larger pool of potential customers to identify those who share similar features with your seed audience.\n",
        "- Targeting and Evaluation: Use the identified lookalike audience for targeted marketing and track the performance of your campaigns."
